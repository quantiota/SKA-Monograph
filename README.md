## Structured Knowledge Accumulation: a first-principles theory of learning and its validation through the Universal Language Manifold.





- ### Part I — Entropy and Structured Knowledge Accumulation (paper I)

    This part introduces the Structured Knowledge Accumulation (SKA) framework by redefining entropy as a dynamic, layer-wise measure of knowledge alignment in neural systems. Learning is formulated as a forward-only process in which knowledge accumulates through local entropy reduction, without backpropagation or global error signals. Classical activation functions, such as the sigmoid, emerge naturally from this entropy-driven formulation, establishing SKA as a principled alternative to optimization-centric learning paradigms.

- ### Part II — Dynamics, Time, and the Principle of Entropic Least Action  (paper II)

    This part extends SKA into a continuous-time formulation, interpreting learning as a dynamical process governed by intrinsic timescales. The learning rate is reinterpreted as a time discretization parameter, revealing time-invariant learning trajectories and characteristic learning times. A variational principle based on entropic least action is introduced, showing that structured knowledge accumulation follows natural evolution laws analogous to physical systems, with convergence emerging from information-theoretic equilibrium rather than heuristic stopping criteria.

- ### Part III — Geometry, Geodesic Learning, and Riemannian Neural Fields  (paper III)

    This part generalizes SKA from discrete architectures to continuous neural fields by introducing a Riemannian geometric formulation. Learning is modeled as knowledge propagation along geodesic paths on an information manifold whose metric emerges from local entropy and structural gradients. Under this framework, neural architecture is no longer predefined but arises naturally from entropy-driven organization, unifying learning dynamics, geometry, and architecture discovery within a single variational principle.

- ### Part IV — The Universal Language Manifold  (paper IV)

    This part applies the Structured Knowledge Accumulation (SKA) framework to human language, showing that linguistic universality emerges from the same entropy-driven principles governing neural learning and geometry. By operating directly on raw acoustic streams, SKA reconstructs a latent language manifold—a shared information geometry in which meaning arises through real-time entropy reduction under the law of entropic least action. Within this formulation, individual languages correspond to different coordinate projections of a common semantic manifold, and translation becomes a geometric transformation rather than symbolic alignment. Crucially, this extension introduces no domain-specific linguistic assumptions, serving instead as a validation of the SKA framework: the same entropic and geometric laws apply unchanged across neural, spatial, and symbolic domains.
